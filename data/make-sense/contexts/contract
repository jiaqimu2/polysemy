contract.v.142	Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), also known as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) or electromyostimulation, is the elicitation of <b> muscle_contraction </b> using electric impulses. EMS has received increasing attention in the last few years because of its potential to serve

This substitution resulted in atrial myocytes that <b> contract </b> and relax more forcefully and quickly, resulting in atrial cardiomyocytes that behave as ventricular cardiomyocytes .

contract.v.148	while all three exercise types did indeed promote muscle growth, isometrics failed to prevent a decrease in the amount of <b> contractile_proteins </b> found in the muscle tissue. The result was muscle degradation at a molecular level. As contractile proteins are what
